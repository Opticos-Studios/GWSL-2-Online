## Update Aug-Oct 2024
* Microsoft is rolling out an update that can break GWSL.
* We are working on a fix.
* Meanwhile, please join the Discord server below for help. We can get things working until the fix is released.

  
## GWSL Shortcuts Not Working After The recent update (1.3.9 or 1.4.0)?
* I believe this is due to a new Windows bug but I am not sure.
* To fix the problem, go to Windows Settings --> Apps --> Apps & Features --> App Execution Aliases, and toggle GWSL off and back on.
* Still no success? See below, you may have another issue.
